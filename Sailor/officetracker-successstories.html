              Bob During, Wine Clue Coordinator gave us some background: "Prior to Office Tracker we were doing all of our Tasting Room tour and event scheduling by hand in a yearly calendar. Because we are always trying to improve on what we do and to offer more to our customers we felt we needed a better scheduling system."
            </p>
            <p>
              Bob continued, "Although the time it took using the previous method to enter the original tour, tasting or event was not as efficient as we wanted. The place where we see the biggest difference is that we can now schedule multiple events in different locations, at the same time and the ways with which we can move a scheduled ooking from one date and time to a different date. No more erasing and re-writting, forgetting credit card or re-entering phone numbers. All the detailed information for each visitor transfers with ease. In addition, many people have access to the schedule from different locations, which makes our response time to our customers faster and more accureate."
            </p>
            <p>
              There are three people who use Office Tracker on a daily basis and two who use in one occasion. They use Office Tracker to schedule tastins, tours, and special events at a winery. Office Tracker allows them to quickly see when time would be available for a tour, tasting or special event. They print the schedule out each morning to assign a staff member to each group for visitor.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Office Tracker filled our present need by giving us the flexibility to expand our current offerings while at the same time providing us with the ability to increase the number of events we can offer as we continue to enhance the winery experience at Grgich Hills. We are very happy with Office Tracker and how it's working for us!" said Bob.

              Tomball Regional Medical Center is a 350 bed Acute Care Hospital. Before Office Tracker scheduling for the Imaging and Rehab staff  was done on a dry erase marker board or printed paper schedules out and posted them on a wall. The schedules were not remotely accessible so users had to physically come to view them throughout the day, it was also difficult to change, so mistakes were more likely to occur. With dry erase boards a great deal of information had to be written over again just to move a single time slot which was clumsy and time consuming.  In addition the big board was not visually pleasing and did not fully represent the workload for the day. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phil Regas, Director of CV Imaging/Cardia Rehab had used the Office Tracker software at two other facilities. The decision to implement it at the Tomball Regional Medical Center was made in cooperation with a small group. The Departmental Director championed it and the staff liked it immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              Office Tracker provides immediate access to the schedules for all involved staff members, it also provides remote viewing, and the use of timed email alerts to remind physicians of upcoming appointments. Regas, said "With Office Tracker we now use 3 large screen LCD's and have 6 remote PC's that are able to access and make changes to the schedule. The Director can look at the schedule from his office and by using status color changes he can get an immediate understanding of where the work is in relation to the day.
            </p>
            <p>
              We know we are saving at least one hour per day in moving from a dry erase board to the PC based software. This alone would add up to several hundred dollars in a single month. In addition, we have reduced errors such as writing out the wrong procedure. We also save in paper to print schedules out for other departments, and we save the time it used to take in transporting the paper schedules to each department or individual. We have improved our customer satisfaction by using the new system to update patient families.

              DATV  is the non-profit, community television station in Dayton, OH.  Citizens who use our video editing facilities have always had to sign up using the paper calendar method. After they find an available room and date, they would then fill out a request form, give it to a staff member who walked it back to the calendar and manually wrote in their request. Additionally, we have citizens calling and asking if a specific date, room, and time are available. Our staff would then have to get up, walk back to the room where the calendars are located (but a phone isn’t) just to see if that that date, room and time was available. As you can imagine, if it was not available, you could be doing a lot of walking and talking back and forth. In addition, at the end of each year we would manually count up the hours used on each of 6 to 8 calendars for use in our Annual Reports. 
            </p>
            <p>
              We needed a program that could be easily learned and easily used. We also needed a calendar that could be posted to the web and viewed by community members from the comfort of their own homes. Office Tracker fit our needs perfectly. As one who hates to read documentation, the demo was so intuitive; I just started playing around Office Tracker and had it doing everything we needed it to do.  Not only does it [Office Tracker] save DATV money, but as importantly it saves us time. Concurrently, the time, effort and money it saves our members not having to drive into our facility to sign up for an Edit Suite or Studio is immeasurable. As a community based organization, it’s our mission to serve the citizens of Dayton in the most effective way possible. Office Tracker is one of the best tools for helping us meet that mission.
            </p>
            <p>
              All 10 employees schedule members for editing and studio usage. Often, we’re busy assisting other members with technical needs. As a result, we have to stop helping them in order to sign someone up for a room. Now not only can people call in their request, they can email their request. This obviously frees up staff to take care of more pressing issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              The key benefits are: simple; ease of use for staff, easy to understand calendars, powerful interface, and comprehensive and easy to understand reports. Office Tracker is exactly what we were looking for. Not only does it save a tremendous amount of time in signing people up. It saves us a great deal of time producing our year-end statistics. No more manually entering or manually counting the hours used. Steve Ross

              <p>
              White Dragon Martial Arts is one of the only schools in San Diego that specializes in offering all students one-on-one private lessons.  As a result, a versatile scheduling program is needed to keep track of these lessons on a weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly basis.  We have over 2,000 active students in 8 locations.
            </p>
            <p>
              We started using Office Tracker in 2000.  Before that, all our schedules were done on paper.  So as you can imagine, Office Tracker was a huge step up.  In fact, this program fit our needs so well that we used it all the way until we upgraded in 2011 ­without even changing the version for more than a decade!  Before, we had to match up paper calendars by flipping pages from instructor to instructor.  It was very time consuming and very susceptible to error.  And every error, would of course, come to us as a cost (a student that was less that impressed).  We care a lot about our professionalism, so Office Tracker has really helped us to step up our game and offer lessons taught perfectly on time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our scheduling problems have virtually disappeared (90%) since we switched over to Office Tracker from paper schedules.
            </p>
            <p>
              The program’s color-labeling feature is very good for us to keep track of the outcome of each lesson.  So in that sense, the administrative task of keeping attendance and tracking employee’s hours worked is very easy to do.  I would estimate that it has cut our administrative costs by 50% as compared to our old scheduling method.
            </p>
            <p>

              Dietz Hydroseeding Co.'s principal location is in Sylmar, California with a satellite office in Orange, CA.  We perform private, commercial and public works projects throughout California.  Dietz Hydroseeding Co. has extensive experience with revegetation, habitat restoration, fire remediation and native plant establishment projects throughout California. We operate 4 trucks with crews of 2 to 3 per truck.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our scheduling program in the 1980s and early 1990s was a large (4' x 6') cork board on the wall with squares painted on it to represent the days and weeks in a month.  Small pieces of paper with truck and crew information were attached to the board to organize the scheduling of jobs.  Changes were made by moving the pieces around the board.
            </p>
            <p>
              Problems with this system, besides the obvious problem of pieces falling off of the board, included the difficulty to incorporate scheduling of personnel along with the equipment.  Also, whenever a change was made by one person in the office, the other office personnel and the crew foremen had to be notified of the change verbally or by written memo.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we found and started using Office Tracker, it was clear that this scheduling program would allow us to efficiently incorporate the personnel and equipment to meet our needs.  We have used Office Tracker ever since. We now spend maybe 20 minutes of administrative time on scheduling. Office Tracker is saving us about 15% in administrative costs just in the reduction of time needed to schedule projects.  We estimate another 15% in savings costs for easier communication between the office and the crews
            </p>
            <p>
              Office Tracker is now not just used for scheduling job personnel and equipment.  We also use Office Tracker to schedule sales appointments, vacation days, and equipment maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Key Benefit of Office Tracker is the ability to efficiently manage and coordinate our equipment and personnel resources. Office Tracker's integrated scheduling improved our efficiency and communication.

              I have owned Blind Magic Window Coverings in Edmonton Alberta Canada for the past 10 years. The business started as a home based business and has grown to ten staff members operating in two retail stores and one central office. We employ Sales Consultants, Installers, Repair Service technicians and office staff. We needed a central resource to keep everyone in sync of whom is come and going on a daily, weekly basis. This is why we originally contacted Office Tracker.
            </p>
            <p>
              We settled on Office Tracker in 2007. We were using a paper scheduling system at the time and as our company grew so did technology. This technology seemed like a necessary tool to keep track of the staff schedules and company meetings. Office Tracker's simple-to-use format with easy data entry fields was the deciding factor. Too many other programs were based on data bases where you have to spend considerable time entering information before you can begin to book an appointment. Office Tracker is simple and effective.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would easily say Office Tracker is 98% more efficient, effective, flexible, track-able, and find-able than the old paper appointment booking system. It is a huge benefit from the old system. All employees can now schedule their own appointments, or the office administrator books it for them in their absence. Either or works. Also, team meeting appointments are now easily scheduled and are available for everyone to book around. All employees can track all other employees' schedules - throw out the In/Out Board on the wall!
            </p>
            <p>
              Everyone at OT has been excellent to deal with. From the initial call, follow up and since continuous follow ups on upgrades...it has been great. We have called the support department approx. 5 times and have always been able to speak with someone that was able to help us out.

              New Horizons Community Church is a Methodist church, we have 3 offices with 7 employees, in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada. We open our building to the community  and allow groups to use our rooms free of charge. This of course requires good scheduling.
            </p>
            <p>
              With so many outside and in house groups using our building keeping track of who was using the various rooms on which day and time was just getting too complex using pencil and paper.
            </p>
            <p>
              I remember one incident that highlights the problems before Office Tracker. We had a woman show up with her florist to look at the church auditorium for her wedding the following Saturday. It was not booked. Our office manager recalled talking to this person, but she was to call back and confirm a few things, the call to confirm never came, but she fully expected to have that wedding! Luckily we were able to accommodate her.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make the choice of Office Tracker, I used the various demos that were offered by all companies I could find. Office Tracker met my needs, was not complicated and I loved the fact that it had a warning if I tried to 'double book' a room.
            </p>
            <p>
              Printing the schedule that can be posted on rooms is very helpful as well. I can book a room and print up a new schedule in a matter of minutes. Something that would take me at least 30 minutes or more, of searching through the booking book and erasing and then going to the computer to print up a new schedule. I would say my old style of pen and paper and then printing a schedule from the computer would take anywhere from 30-60 minutes depending on whether I was just making a booking, or whether I had to cancel and then change a room and date and or time. If I don't have any conflicts then a few minutes to do the same thing with Office Tracker, if I do have a conflict maybe 5 minutes. It's a huge difference and the stress level is certainly reduced! My time is now better utilized.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am the main person that uses Office Tracker as I do all the scheduling, it helps me to manage my time better during the work day. I have more time to work on other aspects of my job.

            <p>
              I found Office Tracker a few years back when I was an Activities Director for another 55 plus community. It worked wonders!
            </p>
            <p>
              When I began my new position as Activities Director, I researched the web to see if Office Tracker was still available and luckily it was. I’ve tried online free trials of other systems, but nothing compared to Office Tracker. I presented the Office Tracker to the Board and gave a presentation on the advantages to using it and then I presented them a comparison of the spreadsheet version we used before and the disadvantages.
            </p>
            <p>
              The old way of using spreadsheets was extremely time consuming. Our office created separate spreadsheets for every month of the year and for every room that required scheduling. Time and effort wasted on the computer when we could have spent the time. Compared to the old way, Office Tracker is 100% more time and cost effective. It is virtually effortless!
            </p>
            <p>
              We use Office Tracker on a daily basis to schedule meetings, parties, entertainment venues, weddings, club activities, card playing, and a newly developed educational program, lectures and exercise programs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The key benefit to using Office Tracker is keeping organized all the events and activities within the community and never having to worry about double booking an event.  Office Tracker provides ease and a confidence in knowing that our scheduling program will go smoothly.

We specialize in a lifestyle. Creating fun and exciting things for our residents, where they can play, learn and enjoy their retirement years.Weston Psychological Associates is a psychology practice that provides mental health services. Presently we have 10 providers and 5 offices. Our offices are located in Weston, Coral Springs, Margate and Miami, Florida. Two of our offices are located in specialty treatment centers; wellness and addiction.  We provide a range of psychological services; individual, family and group psychotherapy and full psychological evaluations. We also provide neuro-feedback and sports psychology services.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prior to purchasing Office Tracker our scheduling was a virtual nightmare. At that time we only had our main office with 5 treatment rooms and 4 providers. We used to use a group practice book that had the offices labeled and the providers had to schedule the office manually. Th is presented all kinds of problems. Our providers could only schedule appointments when they were actually in the office or had to call in to get an office. Sometimes the delay in our ability to schedule a patient would cause us to lose that patient. Initially our executive director and IT consultant began to look for a solution. We underwent a considerable to search to find software that met our needs. Our billing software had a scheduling program but it did not afford us the flexibility that we needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              After an exhaustive search of all the available software, Office Tracker was found to meet our needs. After many years of using Office Tracker it has more than exceeded our expectations, we have doubled the size of our practice and Office Tracker has helped us grow and has grown with us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Office Tracker offered us the ability to schedule multiple offices and multiple providers. It allowed us access to the schedule when we were not physically in the office, which allowed us better customer responses. It also provides us a check and balance to our billing. We are able to check schedule against billing to make sure we have not missed a service that was provided.
            </p>
            <p>
              All 12 of our staff use Office Tracker to schedule patients and treatment rooms. It also allows us to verify billings and to monitor productivity in our satellite offices.
